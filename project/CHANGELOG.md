### Background

Based on Wagih, Larsen & Schuh, *Nature Communications* 11:6376 (2020):
"Learning grain boundary segregation energy spectra in polycrystals"

### Goals

1. **Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) verification**: Use MC + energy minimization to verify
   solute segregation behavior in a binary alloy polycrystal, reproducing key results
   from the paper (segregation enthalpy spectra, equilibrium GB solute concentration).
2. **UMA integration**: Replace classical interatomic potentials with UMA MLIP to
   evaluate whether universal ML potentials can improve segregation energy predictions
   without system-specific potential fitting.

### Method summary (from paper)

- Generate base-metal polycrystal: 20×20×20 nm³, 16 grains, Voronoi tessellation, thermally annealed
- Identify GB sites via common neighbor analysis (CNA)
- For each GB site: place solute atom, relax, compute ΔE_seg = E_GB^solute - E_bulk^solute
- Feature extraction: SOAP descriptors (r_cutoff=6 Å, F^SOAP=1015 features)
- Learning: linear regression on SOAP features → segregation energy
- Accelerated model: PCA (10 components) + k-means clustering (100 training points)

### Project positioning — MC as verification, not method innovation

Advisor's suggestion: *"you could test them by modelling atomistically segregation
in 2D or 3D nanocrystalline structure"* — the key word is **test** (verify).

**Project logic**:
1. Wagih predicts equilibrium GB solute concentration using per-site ΔE + Fermi-Dirac
2. We run MC simulation (more physically complete) to check if predictions hold
3. If they agree → validates Wagih's framework for that system
4. If they disagree → solute-solute interactions / concentration effects matter → new physics
5. UMA extension: can a universal MLIP replace system-specific EAM potentials?

### Why Wagih does NOT use MC (and why we do)

| Aspect                    | MC simulation (ours)            | Wagih per-site + ML           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Goal | Verify predictions | Build alloy-wide database       |
| Cost per (T, X_tot) point | Days of MC                      | Formula evaluation (instant)  |
| Change T or concentration | Re-run MC from scratch          | Plug into Fermi-Dirac (free)  |
| Change alloy system       | Re-run MC                       | Re-compute 100 training points|
| Physics completeness      | Full (solute-solute interaction)| Approximate (dilute limit)    |
| Throughput                | Low (1 alloy at a time)         | High (259 alloys scanned)     |

**Wagih needs throughput** → per-site + ML is the right choice for scanning 259 alloys.
**We need ground truth** → MC is the right choice for verifying specific predictions.

### Key concept: segregation energy spectrum

The spectrum is the distribution of ΔE_seg across all ~10⁵ GB sites in a polycrystal.
It is an **intrinsic material property** independent of T and concentration.

Once the spectrum is known, equilibrium GB occupation at site i follows Fermi-Dirac:

```
P_i(T, X_c) = 1 / [1 + ((1 - X_c) / X_c) × exp(ΔE_i / kT)]
```

- T = temperature, X_c = bulk solute concentration
- Negative ΔE_i → favorable segregation → P_i close to 1
- Average GB concentration: X_GB = (1/N_GB) × Σ P_i

This is analogous to electron filling energy levels — ΔE_i plays the role of energy
levels, and the Fermi-Dirac function determines occupation at given T.

**Compute the spectrum once → predict any (T, X_tot) instantly. This is the power of
Wagih's approach, but it relies on the dilute-limit (non-interacting) assumption.**

### Key concept: accelerated ML model (100 training points)

Full computation: 10⁵ GB sites × LAMMPS relaxation each = very expensive.

Accelerated pipeline:
1. Compute SOAP descriptors for all 10⁵ sites (cheap, no LAMMPS)
2. PCA: 1015-dim SOAP → 10-dim (captures >99% variance)
3. k-means clustering in 10-dim space → 100 clusters
4. Run LAMMPS only for the 100 cluster centroids (representative sites)
5. Train linear regression on these 100 (SOAP_10d, ΔE) pairs
6. Predict ΔE for all 10⁵ sites using the trained model

Result: 100 LAMMPS calculations instead of 100,000 = **1000× speedup**,
MAE increases only from ~2.5 to ~4.2 kJ/mol (Al-Mg example).

### Atom count estimates

For a 20×20×20 nm³ FCC polycrystal: N = (V_box / a³) × 4

| Metal | a (Å) | Atoms in 20³ nm³ |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Al    | 4.05  | ~481,000         |
| Ni    | 3.52  | ~734,000         |
| Cu    | 3.61  | ~680,000         |

GB fraction depends on grain size: ~10–20% for 10–15 nm grains.

### Project roadmap & priority assessment

**Main line (80% effort): MC verification (Fig b)**
- Goal: verify Wagih's per-site + Fermi-Dirac predictions with direct atomistic MC
- Clear scientific question, advisor-endorsed, standalone value
- If predictions agree → validates the framework
- If they disagree → solute-solute interaction effects → new physics

**Extension (20% effort): UMA as drop-in replacement (Fig c)**
- Goal: replace EAM with UMA in Wagih's per-site framework
- NOT using MC with UMA (too slow, no extra scientific value)
- Proof-of-concept on one binary alloy (e.g. Al-Mg), ~10–100 GB sites

### Critical assessment of UMA extension

**Concerns:**
- Speed: UMA (neural network, ~ms/call) much slower than EAM (~μs/call).
  10⁵ relaxations could go from hours to weeks.
- "Just swapping calculator": if UMA matches EAM → "UMA works" but limited novelty.
  If mismatch → who is right? Need DFT ground truth for a few sites.
- GB environments are highly disordered → may be out-of-distribution for UMA.
- Wagih already covered 259 alloys. Re-doing with UMA alone is not enough.

**Where UMA becomes truly valuable:**
- Alloys where NO EAM potential exists (beyond NIST's 259 alloys).
- Multi-component / high-entropy alloys where EAM fitting is impractical.
- If MC verification finds EAM predictions are inaccurate, and UMA is closer to DFT
  → proves UMA is a better energy calculator for segregation.

### Multi-component alloy extension — the long-term payoff

If UMA proves accurate on binary alloys, the natural extension is:

| Alloy type | Combinations | EAM coverage | UMA coverage |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Binary (A-B) | ~4,000+ | ~259 (6%) | All |
| Ternary (A-B-C) | ~50,000+ | Very few (<0.1%) | All |
| High-entropy (5+) | ~millions | ≈ 0 | All |

This is the strongest argument for UMA: **one model covers the entire alloy space**
without system-specific potential fitting.

Multi-component GB segregation is also more physically complex:
- Multiple elements compete for GB sites (co-segregation / site competition)
- Wagih's independent-site Fermi-Dirac model may need modification
- This itself is an open scientific question

**Three-step story for the project:**
1. MC validates Wagih framework on binary alloy (scientific rigor)
2. UMA matches EAM on binary alloy per-site ΔE_seg (proof-of-concept)
3. UMA predicts segregation in multi-component alloys (new predictions, the contribution)

Step 3 is the real contribution, but Steps 1–2 are necessary to establish credibility.

### UMA CPU/GPU benchmark (Al FCC supercells, uma-s-1p1)

**CPU benchmark:**

| N_atoms | Box (Å) | Time (s) | ms/atom |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| 27      | 12.2    | 0.26     | 9.6     |
| 125     | 20.3    | 0.90     | 7.2     |
| 512     | 32.4    | 7.0      | 13.6    |
| 1,000   | 40.5    | 14.3     | 14.3    |

**GPU benchmark (NVIDIA RTX A6000):**

| N_atoms | Box (Å) | Time (s) | ms/atom |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| 125     | 20.3    | 0.07     | 0.58    |
| 512     | 32.4    | 0.24     | 0.47    |
| 1,000   | 40.5    | 0.45     | 0.45    |
| 3,375   | 60.8    | 1.50     | 0.45    |

GPU ~32× faster than CPU at 1000 atoms. Scaling ~N^1.05 (near-linear).

**Extrapolation to polycrystal sizes (GPU):**

| System           | N_atoms | 1 force eval | 1 relaxation (~30 CG) | 100 sites |
|------------------|---------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Al 10³ nm³       | 60K     | ~27 s       | ~13 min              | ~22 hr    |
| Al 20³ nm³       | 480K    | ~216 s      | ~1.8 hr              | ~7.5 days |
| Ni 20³ nm³       | 730K    | ~336 s      | ~2.8 hr              | ~12 days  |

**Conclusion: CPU completely infeasible. GPU marginal for 20³ nm³ (7.5 days for 100 sites).**

### UMA + ML acceleration: marginal value argument

If using Wagih's accelerated model (SOAP + PCA + k-means → 100 training points):

**Error chain analysis:**
- Potential accuracy (EAM vs UMA vs DFT): ~5–20 kJ/mol difference
- ML prediction error (100 pts → 10⁵ pts): ~4.2 kJ/mol MAE

The ML prediction step introduces ~4 kJ/mol noise regardless of whether training data
comes from EAM or UMA. **UMA's accuracy improvement is diluted by ML prediction error.**

Why not use DFT for the 100 points? Because each relaxation is done on the FULL
supercell (~480K atoms) — DFT is impossible at this scale. So the choice is only
EAM vs UMA, and the difference may be smaller than the ML noise floor.

**Verdict: UMA + Wagih's accelerated ML pipeline = not worth the extra computation.**

UMA is only valuable when:
1. Computing ALL sites directly (no ML), on a small system (5³–10³ nm³)
2. Predicting alloys where NO EAM potential exists
But small systems can't capture polycrystalline GB statistics adequately.

### Revised project directions — beyond HMC verification

The project should focus on **stress-testing Wagih's framework**, not on replacing EAM.

**① Dilute-limit breakdown boundary (⭐⭐⭐ core contribution)**
- Wagih assumes independent sites (no solute-solute interaction)
- MC can test this directly by varying total concentration:
  X_tot = 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% → compare X_GB^MC vs X_GB^Wagih
- Define a "critical concentration" above which the framework fails
- This is the paper's potential key figure

**② Solute-solute spatial analysis (⭐⭐⭐ pairs with ①)**
- When MC disagrees with Wagih, WHY?
- Measure: solute clustering at GB, solute-solute g(r), P_i correlation with local density
- Provides physical basis for correcting Wagih's model

**③ Temperature effects (⭐⭐ easy addition)**
- Run MC at multiple temperatures (300K–1200K)
- Compare X_GB(T) curves with Wagih's Fermi-Dirac prediction
- 0K ΔE_seg may not capture vibrational entropy effects at high T

**④ Active learning for training point selection (⭐⭐ methodological)**
- Replace k-means (unsupervised) with uncertainty-guided active learning
- Could achieve same accuracy with 50 points instead of 100
- Or better accuracy (MAE < 4.2 kJ/mol) with same 100 points

**⑤ Multi-configuration statistics (⭐ supplementary)**
- Generate 5–10 different Voronoi polycrystal configurations
- Check if segregation spectra are robust across configurations
- Quantify configuration-to-configuration variance

**Recommended project story:**
1. MC verification of Wagih at standard conditions (baseline)
2. Concentration sweep → dilute-limit failure boundary (core result)
3. Spatial analysis of solute-solute interactions (physical insight)
4. Temperature sweep (supplementary)
5. (Optional) ML improvement / multi-config statistics

### Next steps

1. **Get advisor's nanocrystalline structure generation code**
2. **Pick alloy system** (likely Al-Mg, pending advisor input)
3. **Download EAM potential** from NIST repository
4. **Download Wagih's data** from Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.4107058) for comparison
5. **Prepare MC simulation script skeleton** (LAMMPS Python interface)
